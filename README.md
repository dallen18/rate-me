# Rate Me!

1. Idea: My project will be a rating website, that allows users to blog and critique recently
   watched movies and tv series.
2. Motivation: Since the pandemic began, I have been spending much more time at home
   than I would under normal circumstances. This has led to a larger consumption of
   television and subsequently created a need for a reliable source of review options. I
   found that many review critics may have ulterior motives when rating a review or writing
   their reviews. A common theme on social media accounts has been starting a thread
   with “What should I watch tonight, any suggestions?”. This suggests that people are
   looking for a way to find that series that helps pass the time. I would prefer to see what
   my friends and family have watched recently and see how they rate it and why. With
   the lack of social interaction, I believe this is a great way to stay connected with others
   during this period and have discussions about common interests.
3. Application: This web app allows users to create a profile. From this profile the user can
   add movies, tv-series, and many other viewing content options,
   and gives them the option to rate and review this material. The user also has the option to rate
   and review material that others have added, and can read what other users have posted.
4. Application Name: Rate Me!
