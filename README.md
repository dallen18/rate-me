# H1 Rate Me!

1. Idea: My project will be a rating website, that allows users to blog and critique recently
   watched movies and tv series.
2. Motivation: Since the pandemic began, I have been spending much more time at home
   than I would under normal circumstances. This has led to a larger consumption of
   television and subsequently created a need for a reliable source of movie options. I
   found that many movie critics may have ulterior motives when rating a movie or writing
   their reviews. A common theme on social media accounts has been starting a thread
   with “What should I watch tonight, any suggestions?”. This suggests that people are
   looking for a way to find that series that helps pass the time. I would prefer to see what
   my friends and family have watched recently and see how they rate it and why. With
   the lack of social interaction, I believe this is a great way to stay connected with others
   during this period and have discussions about common interests.
3. Application: This web app allows users to add friends and view their page. Each user’s
   page will contain movie, tv series, and documentary ratings with an option to write
   about why they liked or disliked the production. The user also has the option of
   providing the service in which they viewed the film, allowing others to easily find and
   enjoy the product as well.
